This includes acute care-focused updates—especially for adults—from major clinical trials, guideline updates, and FDA news.\n\nI’ll present a ranked list with titles and direct links from reputable sources. I’ll let you know as soon as it’s ready.\n\n\n1. **2025 Guidelines: Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACC/AHA/ACEP)** – Major update for managing ACS (NSTEMI/STEMI), including refined dual antiplatelet therapy duration, high-intensity statins for all, radial-first PCI, intravascular imaging guidance, cardiogenic shock management (microaxial pumps), and enhanced secondary prevention recommendations.\n\n2. **Tenecteplase Approved for Ischemic Stroke Thrombolysis** – The FDA approved tenecteplase for acute ischemic stroke (March 2025), providing an alternative to alteplase after trials showed non-inferior outcomes. New stroke-specific tenecteplase dosing and packaging will facilitate its use in lieu of tPA.\n\n3. **No Benefit of Thrombectomy in Medium/Distal Stroke Occlusions** – Randomized trials (ESCAPE-MeVO, DISTAL) reported no improvement in 90-day outcomes with endovascular therapy for medium or distal vessel occlusion strokes, and potentially higher risks, compared to medical care alone.\n\n4. **First Biologic for COPD: Dupilumab Approved** – Dupilumab was approved as the first monoclonal antibody for inadequately controlled COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype, significantly reducing annual exacerbation rates (\\~30–34% relative reduction) in Phase 3 trials.\n\n5. **Long-Acting HIV PrEP: Injectable Lenacapavir** – The FDA approved lenacapavir, a twice-yearly subcutaneous injection for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. In large trials, lenacapavir conferred \\~96–100% risk reduction in new HIV infections across diverse populations.\n\n6. **New HAE Prophylaxis: Garadacimab Monoclonal** – The FDA approved garadacimab-gxii (June 2025) as a first-in-class monoclonal antibody targeting FXII for prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema. In the pivotal VANGUARD trial, monthly SC garadacimab cut mean HAE attack frequency to \\~0.27 per month vs 2.01 on placebo (p<0.0001).\n\n7. **Infant RSV Prevention: Merck’s Enflonsia (Clesrovimab)** – A new long-acting monoclonal antibody (Enflonsia) gained FDA approval (June 9, 2025) to prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and infants entering their first RSV season. A single 105 mg IM dose provides \\~5 months protection and significantly reduced RSV illnesses and hospitalizations in trials.\n\n8. **VR Therapy for Headache Relief** – A randomized study (Annals of EM, June 2025) found that virtual reality combined with classical music significantly reduced pain and improved mood in patients with acute tension-type headaches. This non-pharmacologic approach may decrease medication use for headache management.\n\n9. **AI-Guided Ultrasound for DVT Diagnosis** – A multicenter trial demonstrated that an AI-assisted handheld ultrasound system (AutoDVT) used by non-specialists could accurately rule out deep vein thrombosis. Investigators estimated 29–50% of comprehensive radiology DVT exams could be avoided by deploying an AI-guided two-point compression ultrasound protocol.\n\n10. **AAP Bronchiolitis Guideline Update (2023)** – New pediatric bronchiolitis guidelines emphasize supportive care (hydration and oxygen) and advise against routine viral testing, radiography, lab studies, bronchodilator trials, epinephrine, or chest physiotherapy in infants with bronchiolitis. Diagnosis and severity should be assessed clinically, and palivizumab prophylaxis reserved for select high-risk infants only.\n\n11. **Gene Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease Approved** – The FDA approved the first cell-based gene therapies for sickle cell disease (Dec 2023): *Casgevy* (utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 editing) and *Lyfgenia* (lentiviral vector). In trials, \\~93.5% of evaluable patients had no severe vaso-occlusive crises for ≥12 months post-treatment, marking a transformational advance for SCD management.\n\n12. **BV Recurrence Reduction via Partner Treatment** – A landmark trial showed that treating male partners of women with bacterial vaginosis using dual therapy (oral metronidazole + topical clindamycin) alongside standard care for the woman reduced BV recurrences (35% vs 63% recurrence at 12 weeks when only the woman was treated). This suggests partner treatment can improve outcomes in recurrent BV.\n\n13. **Egg Allergy No Longer a Vaccine Contraindication** – Current evidence shows hen’s egg allergy is not a reason to withhold any vaccines (including influenza and yellow fever). Practice has shifted to *no longer inquire about egg allergy prior to vaccination*, as even patients with severe egg allergy tolerate standard vaccine formulations without incident. Providers still observe the usual post-vaccine monitoring, but special protocols for egg-allergic recipients are no longer needed.\n\n14. **Antibiotic Recall: Contaminated SMX/TMP Tablets** – On June 4, 2025, the FDA announced a recall of three lots of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (400 mg/80 mg) tablets after certain bottles were found to have visible black particulate contamination. Affected lots (100- and 500-count bottles distributed Dec 2024–May 2025) were pulled due to potential microbial contamination risks.\n\n15. **Ineffective Decongestant to be Pulled** – After a unanimous FDA advisory committee finding that orally administered **phenylephrine** (common OTC nasal decongestant) is not effective, the FDA in late 2024 proposed removing oral phenylephrine from the OTC monograph. The proposal cites extensive data showing no benefit of standard-dose oral phenylephrine vs placebo. Patients are advised to use alternative congestion remedies (e.g. pseudoephedrine or nasal sprays) as oral phenylephrine’s days on the market are numbered.\n\n\n# Top 15 EM Practice-Changing Updates (Since June 1, 2025)\n\n1. **2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP Acute Coronary Syndromes Guideline** – New multi-society ACS guidelines (first since 2013) update evidence-based recommendations for managing unstable angina and MI (NSTEMI/STEMI), including 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy in low-bleeding-risk patients and preference for radial-access PCI.\n\n2. **ACEP Reaffirms EMTALA Obligations Post-Guidance Rescission** – In June 2025, ACEP asserted that emergency physicians must continue to provide stabilizing care (including in pregnancy-related emergencies) under EMTALA, after CMS rescinded a 2022 EMTALA guidance on emergency reproductive care.\n\n3. **Physician On-Site Requirement in ED (South Carolina Law)** – Effective May 12, 2025, South Carolina now mandates at least one physician physically present in all hospital EDs at all times. Modeled on prior laws in VA and IN, this law aims to preserve high-quality, physician-led emergency care.\n\n4. **VR + Music Relieves Acute Tension Headache (RCT)** – A June 2025 RCT in *Annals of EM* found that adding virtual-reality forest scenery with classical music to standard NSAID therapy significantly reduced pain (VAS) and improved mood in ED patients with tension-type headaches.\n\n5. **FDA Approves **Andembry** (Garadacimab) for HAE Prophylaxis** – On June 16, 2025, FDA approved garadacimab-gxii, a first-in-class factor XIIa inhibitor, as a once-monthly injectable prophylactic to prevent hereditary angioedema attacks in patients ≥12 years.\n\n6. **FDA Approves **Enflonsia** (Clesrovimab) for Infant RSV Prevention** – On June 9, 2025, FDA approved Merck’s Enflonsia™, a long-acting monoclonal antibody for preventing RSV lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and infants entering their first RSV season.\n\n7. **FDA Approves **Yeztugo** (Lenacapavir) – 6-Month HIV PrEP Injection** – In mid-June 2025, FDA approved long-acting injectable lenacapavir (every-6-months, branded Yeztugo) as the first extended-duration PrEP option to prevent HIV infection.\n\n8. **No Benefit of Thrombectomy in Medium Vessel Stroke (ESCAPE-MeVO Trial)** – A multinational RCT reported that endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic strokes due to medium-vessel occlusions (M2/medium arteries) *within 12 hours* conferred no 90-day outcome advantage over medical therapy. This supports limiting thrombectomy to large-vessel occlusions in current practice.\n\n9. **IV Iron Falls Short in Systolic Heart Failure (FAIR-HF2)** – The FAIR-HF2 trial (ACC 2025) found that IV ferric carboxymaltose in HFrEF patients with iron deficiency did **not** significantly improve hard outcomes (HF hospitalizations or CV death) versus placebo, tempering enthusiasm for routine ED-initiated IV iron for acute HF.\n\n10. **BedMed Trial: BP Meds Timing Doesn’t Matter** – The BedMed and BedMed-Frail RCTs (2025) showed no difference in cardiovascular outcomes or mortality whether patients took antihypertensives in the morning or at bedtime, confirming prior evidence that timing is clinically insignificant.\n\n11. **EAST Guideline on REBOA in Trauma** – In March 2025, the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma issued a new practice management guideline on resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) for hemorrhage control, providing multidisciplinary consensus on indications, technique, and patient selection in ED/trauma settings.\n\n12. **CDC Narrows COVID Vaccine Guidance – EM Concerns** – Mid-2025, U.S. health authorities scaled back universal COVID-19 booster recommendations (focusing on high-risk groups). ACEP voiced alarm that reduced vaccination could leave frontline providers and patients more vulnerable in future outbreaks.\n\n13. **Naloxone Nasal Spray Shelf-Life Extended to 4 Years** – In 2024 and acknowledged by FDA in early 2025, Emergent BioSolutions extended the shelf life of OTC Narcan® 4 mg nasal spray from 36 to 48 months. This improves stockpiling and availability of the opioid overdose antidote for emergency use.\n\n14. **ACEP Clinical Policy: Carbon Monoxide Poisoning (2025)** – ACEP approved a new evidence-based clinical policy (Jan 22, 2025) on evaluation and management of adult patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning. It provides guidance on CO level interpretation, hyperbaric oxygen indications, and discharge criteria for ED patients.\n\n15. **Virtual Reality in Emergency Care Innovation** – (Honorable mention) Emergency physicians are increasingly exploring immersive technologies like VR for acute pain and anxiety management. The tension headache trial (#4 above) and similar studies highlight a growing trend of non-pharmacologic adjuncts in the ED, aligning with opioid-sparing initiatives.\n"
